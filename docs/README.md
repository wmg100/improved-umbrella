### Raehl's backstory

Raehl grew up an orphan in Tillamoor, a small town north of Waterdeep. Life was hard sometimes, but his circumstance gave him the freedom to pursue any interest without expectations. When he wasn't running the streets causing mischief with his friends, Raehl would spend hours in the orphanage library reading about anything that piqued his curiosity. His aptitude for learning quickly set him apart from his peers.

During his teenage years, a traveling wizard named Yenavor was passing through Tillamoor when a local thief tried to steal his coin purse. Raehl exposed the plot, and in thanks Yenavor insisted on buying a meal for the urchin. While the two ate, Yenavor spoke of great magic and the arcane. Yenavor's stories enthralled Raehl, and he himself noted Raehl's intellect and endless curiosity. At meal's end Yenavor was resolved; Raehl must accompany him to Blackstaff Tower where he could receive formal training in the art. Raehl packed his few belongings and said goodbye to Harriet, the orphanage's halfling proprietor who had become the closest thing to family Raehl had ever known.

Raehl studied as Yenavor's apprentice at Blackstaff Tower and learned about the history of the realms, of magical theory and the weave, and of the creation of the multiverse itself. He also met Caelin, a fellow student and skilled spellcaster who would become his closest confidant during his time as an apprentice. While grateful for the opportunities the tower provided, Raehl became increasingly disillusioned with his isolation from the larger world. Knowledge, in his view, should be used for society's benefit. Believing that the tower's mages weren't doing enough to help the people of Waterdeep and beyond, Raehl set off to make his own way.
